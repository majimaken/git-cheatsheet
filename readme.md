# Unix Command Cheat Sheet

## Unix Operating System (OS)

UNIX is an operating system created by AT&T's Bell Laboratories and allows multi-tasking and multi-user. Operating systems like Mac OS, Linux, Android OS, iOS and Chrome OS are examples that are based on Unix. 
Unix consists of three parts: the kernel, the shell and the code. The kernel is responsible for the communication with the computer hardware and therefore manages CPU and RAM. 
The shell is an command line interpreter (CLI) and is placed between the user and the kernel. It interprets the inputs the user does and forwards the commands to the kernel for execution. 
The code itself are the commands the user enters into the CLI. 

The following cheat sheet should help get an overview of the most important commands.

## Basics 

First, we want to introduce you to the basic commands that are required for the usage of Git and GitHub. 

|Code|Description|
|---|---|
|dir|Show the current directory you are working in|
|cd Documents/Projects/Time-Series|Change directory to folder Time-Series|
|cd ..|Change directory to one level higher (back to Projects)|
|mkdir test-project|Make new directory called test-project|
|touch readme.me|Create file called readme.md|

## Git and GitHub

Git is an open-source version control tool created by developers working on the Linux operating system in 2005. On the other handGitHub is a 2008-based company that provide the interface to make the usage of Git easier.Â
